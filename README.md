# Overview

This is a tarot card app. The current version stores all tarot cards (each associated with a number) in a json file. When the user runs the program via ```python tarot_frontend.py```, a random
tarot card is returned.

I plan to revamp this program, potentially switching to HTML/CSS/JS and connecting to a tarot API for the card descriptions as well as taking user input. Stay tuned!
